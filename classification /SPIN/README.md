Code for running the GREEDY approach of the method SPIN. 
The method is developed by [Hongyu SU](https://github.com/hongyusu) and in this project we use the  author's original implementation. 

The directory contains the code for running the method locally and on triton, the computing cluster at Aalto University.

All files in the directory belong to the author of SPIN. 

The directory contains the scripts to run the GREEDY labeling version of SPIN. Script onto_greedy_labeling has been 
implemented to suit the ontology data for directed inference. The scripts run_SPIN_Greedy and SPIn_Greedy have been only modified to take the input from the ontology data and the output the corresponding results.
