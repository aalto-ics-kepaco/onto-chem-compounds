onto-chem-compounds
===================

About:
Code for classification of a molecular species in an ontology from molecular fingerprints.  Fingerprints are used
to represent  chemical compounds, and for each of the compounds there exists a ontological  classification in form of
directed acyclic graph (DAG). 


Methods: 
We use structured prediction method developed for network response named SPIN. We use SVM as the baseline classifier.
